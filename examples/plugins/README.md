# Plugins

Each source plugin owns its `.csproj`. `make run` regenerates the C# API, publishes every source
project as NativeAOT, replaces staged example `.so` files, then starts the server.

The loader accepts compatible precompiled `.so` files, but `make run` is source-owned and cleans
its staged binaries. Stage a precompiled file after the build and start the server directly when
testing binary-only delivery.

`kitchen-sink` uses every exposed C# API and grows with each parity slice. Its `block` overload
demonstrates `World.Tx`, `Cube.Pos`, typed `Block.Sand`, and `World.SetOpts` without exposing block
identifiers or NBT. Its `item` overload round-trips typed finite-state items, books, fireworks,
and all 28 tiered armour states through player inventory while the private transport keeps item
identifiers and NBT out of plugin code, including dyed leather and armour trims.

`vanilla-commands` keeps each command in its own file and grows as more of Dragonfly's gameplay API is exposed.
