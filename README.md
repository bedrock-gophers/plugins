# bedrock-gophers/plugins

C# NativeAOT plugins for [df-mc/dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly).

The public C# API follows Dragonfly. The native ABI is internal plumbing, and generated C# API code is derived from Dragonfly's Go AST rather than a separate public schema.

## Run

Requirements: Go 1.26+, .NET 10 SDK, and a C compiler/linker.

```shell
make run
```

`make run` always regenerates the AST-derived C# API, republishes the runtime and every
`examples/plugins/*/*.csproj` as NativeAOT, replaces staged example `.so` files, then starts the
server. It does not reuse an older plugin build.

Consumer repositories keep plugins in `plugins/`; see the `minimal` branch for the local and
Docker setup. The loader also accepts compatible precompiled `.so` files. Source-owned build
commands replace their staged output, so precompiled files are staged after that build or run
directly with the server.

## Plugin

Plugin code does not declare an ID, shared-library path, or native entry point:

```csharp
using Dragonfly;

public sealed class Example : Plugin
{
    public override void OnEnable() => Console.WriteLine("enabled");
    public override void OnDisable() => Console.WriteLine("disabled");

    public override void HandleQuit(Player player)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{player.Name()} quit");
    }
}
```

The project name is the plugin ID. A compile-time generator emits the hidden native entry point.

Current C# slice: loading, lifecycle, reflected commands, player text actions, game mode, movement, chat, food loss, jump, teleport, sprint/sneak toggles, punch-air, and quit handlers. Player handler, command-interface, and player-text surfaces are generated from Dragonfly's Go AST. `examples/plugins/kitchen-sink` compiles against every exposed C# API and grows with each parity slice.

World callbacks now carry Dragonfly-shaped transactions. `Player.Context` inherits
`World.Context`, which inherits `World.Tx`; commands receive the same `World.Tx`. `Cube.Pos`,
`World.Block`, `World.Liquid`, `World.SetOpts`, and the current `World.Tx` block-query surface are generated from
Dragonfly source. This includes `Range`, `Block`, `BlockLoaded`, `BlocksWithin`, `SetBlock`,
`Liquid`, `SetLiquid`, `HighestLightBlocker`, `HighestBlock`, `Light`, and `SkyLight`, plus 79
stateless concrete block types, `Block.Sand`, `Block.Water`, and `Block.Lava`:

```csharp
var pos = Cube.PosFromVec3(source.Position()).Side(Cube.Face.Down);
var (block, loaded) = tx.BlockLoaded(pos);
World.Block? previous = loaded ? block : tx.Block(pos);
Cube.Range bounds = tx.Range();
var nearby = tx.BlocksWithin(pos, 8, new Block.Sand());
tx.SetBlock(pos, new Block.Sand());
var (liquid, found) = tx.Liquid(pos);
tx.SetLiquid(pos, new Block.Water(Still: true, Depth: 8, Falling: false));
tx.SetLiquid(pos, null); // Remove the liquid.
```

`BlocksWithin` stays lazy across the private ABI: each C# enumerator owns a transaction-scoped
Dragonfly iterator and closes it on exhaustion, early exit, or callback completion.

Public block and liquid types come from Dragonfly's Go AST. Their canonical registry states feed
an internal generated codec, so Minecraft identifiers and state NBT never enter plugin code. The
private host ABI 24 preserves the separate “no liquid” result and nullable liquid removal. World
handles and ABI errors also remain private transport details.
