# Native Plugin Architecture Plan

Status: Active implementation; managed worlds, blocks, typed particles, and typed sounds complete

Initial language: Rust

Primary goals:

- Keep hot event handling close to raw Dragonfly performance.
- Make plugin code idiomatic and small.
- Make adding another plugin language require one thin SDK/runtime shim, not a rewrite of every event adapter.
- Own the Dragonfly server lifecycle so users never attach handlers or worlds manually.
- Let plugins configure, create, inspect, and retire worlds through the generated SDK.
- Reach behavioral parity with Dragonfly's public server extension points, including custom blocks, items, entities, providers, generators, and registries.
- Keep Dragonfly transaction and object lifetime rules intact.
- Keep the binary contract independent from Go and Rust ABI changes.

## Decision

Build an opinionated Dragonfly server runtime around one schema-driven C ABI:

```text
bedrock-gophers server
   |
Dragonfly lifecycle and world manager
   |
Go host adapter
   |
generated C ABI
   |
Rust runtime
   |
Rust plugin libraries
```

The framework owns `Config.New`, `Listen`, `Accept`, player attachment, every managed world, and shutdown. Server operators run the provided executable; they do not write integration Go code.

The Go host makes one FFI call per event. The Rust runtime dispatches that event to every subscribed Rust plugin using cheap native function calls. This avoids one cgo crossing per plugin.

C is only the stable ABI shape. Plugin authors use an idiomatic Rust SDK and write no C.

## Dragonfly constraints

This design is pinned to Dragonfly v0.11.0 / `master` commit `5e99a4689878f6f2cd39816ec87fb795da870fb0` (verified 2026-07-12).

Relevant upstream behavior:

- Dragonfly is a Go library, not a standalone plugin host.
- Players are yielded through `Server.Accept()` and are valid only inside that iterator callback.
- A player has one `player.Handler`; a world has one `world.Handler`.
- Many handlers are synchronous, cancellable, or mutate pointer arguments.
- Most world/entity work occurs inside `world.Tx`.
- `world.Tx` is not safe for concurrent use.
- Calling blocking `world.Call`, `World.Save`, or `World.Close` from that world's owner callback deadlocks.
- `EntityHandle` is the persistent, transaction-safe identity for an entity.

The ABI must not expose Go pointers, Go interfaces, `player.Player`, `world.Entity`, or `world.Tx`.

## Minimise adapter code

Maintain one language-neutral API schema:

```text
schema/
  player.yaml
  events/
    player.yaml
    world.yaml
    inventory.yaml
  capabilities/
    blocks.yaml
    items.yaml
    entities.yaml
    worlds.yaml
    server.yaml
```

Example schema:

```yaml
states:
  - name: experience_level
    id: 6
    type: i32
    set: SetExperienceLevel
    get: ExperienceLevel
    rust_set: set_experience_level
    rust_get: experience_level
    validate: non_negative
```

Player entries map the stable ABI ID, Dragonfly method, idiomatic Rust method, wire value type, validation, and optional named adapter. Named adapters cover semantics that method reflection cannot express, such as game-mode conversion and damage/healing sources.

A generator produces:

- C structs, event IDs, ABI tables, and layout assertions.
- Go ABI types and conversion skeletons.
- Go player dispatch and validation.
- Rust raw `#[repr(C)]` bindings.
- Idiomatic Rust `Player` methods.
- Rust safe mutable event types.
- Rust handler dispatch code.
- Event reference documentation.
- Test fixtures containing known ABI layouts.

Adding a direct player action or property requires only a schema entry. Adding an event requires:

1. Add schema entry.
2. Implement Dragonfly-to-schema mapping in Go.
3. Regenerate everything else.

No Rust adapter change should be required. Future language SDKs consume the same generated ABI metadata.

Each language needs only:

- Generated ABI types.
- One small runtime shim that exports the entry point.
- Idiomatic wrappers around borrowed strings, slices, IDs, mutable event state, and host errors.

Do not generate plugin business logic or force plugin authors to handle generic byte buffers.

Add a `dragonfly-api-scan` tool using Go type information. It inventories Dragonfly's exported extension interfaces and compares them with the schema. CI fails when the pinned Dragonfly version adds or changes an interface without an explicit supported, deferred, or intentionally unsupported classification. This prevents silent parity drift.

## ABI shape

Use a generic dispatch entry point with generated typed payloads:

```c
typedef uint32_t DfEventId;

typedef struct {
    uint32_t abi_version;
    uint32_t struct_size;
    uint64_t feature_bits;
} DfAbiHeader;

typedef struct {
    DfAbiHeader header;
    void *instance;
    DfStatus (*handle_event)(
        void *instance,
        DfEventId event_id,
        const void *input,
        void *output
    );
    void (*destroy)(void *instance);
} DfPluginApiV1;

const DfPluginApiV1 *df_plugin_entry_v1(void);
```

Generated Rust dispatch converts `event_id` and pointers into typed SDK calls. Plugin authors never match raw IDs or dereference pointers.

Every ABI structure must:

- Use fixed-width integer types.
- Use explicit discriminants for enums.
- Use pointer-plus-length views for borrowed data.
- State ownership and lifetime.
- Avoid platform-sized `long`, `size_t` in persisted layouts, and C bitfields.
- Have generated size, alignment, and offset tests.

The ABI is intentionally strict while the project is WIP. A breaking layout or callback change increments the host ABI version, and mismatched runtimes/plugins fail to load. Compatibility shims are deferred until the API is stable enough to justify them.

## Runtime

Go loads one Rust runtime library. Rust runtime loads plugin `.so`, `.dylib`, or later `.dll` files with local symbol visibility.

Runtime responsibilities:

- Discover manifests and native libraries.
- Validate ABI version and target architecture.
- Resolve dependencies with a topological sort.
- Reject duplicate plugin IDs.
- Build per-event subscriber arrays.
- Sort handlers by priority, then plugin ID.
- Dispatch events and carry mutable event state between handlers.
- Catch Rust panics before they cross FFI.
- Track plugin lifecycle and disabled state.
- Prefix plugin logs.
- Expose event subscription bitsets to Go.

The runtime must not unload plugin libraries. Rust threads, TLS, function pointers, and static destructors make hot `dlclose` unsafe. Reload means server restart. A plugin may be logically disabled by removing it from subscriber arrays.

## Server ownership

This project provides the server executable. Normal operation is:

```shell
bedrock-gophers serve --config server.toml
```

Internal startup sequence:

1. Read base server configuration.
2. Discover and validate native plugins.
3. Run plugin bootstrap callbacks and collect a declarative `ServerPlan`.
4. Resolve configuration and world-definition conflicts deterministically.
5. Build Dragonfly `server.Config` and call `Config.New`.
6. Register the three Dragonfly core worlds with the world manager.
7. Create plugin-defined worlds.
8. Install all player, world, and inventory dispatchers automatically.
9. Run plugin enable callbacks.
10. Call `Listen` and own the `Accept` loop.
11. On shutdown, stop accepting players, disable plugins in reverse order, close worlds, then destroy the Rust runtime.

No public `AttachWorld` or `AttachPlayer` API exists. A world cannot enter the registry without its dispatcher already installed. A player receives its dispatcher before plugin-visible join processing.

The Go host provides the authoritative `player.Handler`, `world.Handler`, and inventory handlers. Internal framework handlers run first, then Rust plugins by priority and ID, then Dragonfly consumes final context and pointer values.

Cancellation is monotonic. Later handlers cannot uncancel an event.

The host does not retain `*player.Player`. It retains `EntityHandle` and generation-tagged IDs where persistent lookup is required.

Go conversion code is the unavoidable adapter because Dragonfly uses Go-specific interfaces and concrete types. Keep conversion next to each handler and test it against Dragonfly semantics.

## World manager

Worlds are first-class managed resources, not objects server owners attach manually.

Reserved core world IDs:

```text
minecraft:overworld
minecraft:nether
minecraft:end
```

Plugin worlds use namespaced IDs:

```text
example:minigame_lobby
example:arena_1
```

World manager currently owns:

- World registry and opaque, never-reused handles.
- Persistent creation/loading through namespaced IDs and `mcdb` below a configured root.
- Handler installation before publication.
- Core-world protection.
- Occupancy checks before unload.
- Save, close, stale-handle rejection, and shutdown lifecycle.
- Transaction-aware block reads/writes.

Current Rust SDK exposes:

```rust
let lobby = World::open("example:lobby", Dimension::Overworld);
if let Some(lobby) = lobby {
    lobby.set_time(6000);
    lobby.set_block(
        BlockPos { x: 0, y: 64, z: 0 },
        &block::new("minecraft:stone"),
    );
}
```

`World::get` resolves core or custom names. `World::open` loads or creates a persistent custom world. Block properties preserve Dragonfly's exact `bool`, `uint8`, `int32`, and `string` state types through tagged little-endian NBT. Setters expose no host transport errors; lookup and reads return `Option` for unavailable/stale resources.

Remaining world parity:

- World listing, dimensions, loaded-only block reads, and block-entity NBT.
- Memory/flat/provider/generator specs and portal routing.
- Player evacuation and transfer between worlds.
- Typed sounds and particles.
- World load/unload events and plugin access policy.
- Rust-defined providers and generators through capability adapters.

Core worlds may be configured during bootstrap but cannot be removed while the server runs. Unloading another world requires an evacuation destination and fails if evacuation cannot complete.

Initial world specs support framework-owned providers and generators: persistent, memory-only, flat, empty, overworld, nether, and end. Rust-defined generators and providers use capability adapters described below.

## Dragonfly capability bridge

Full plugin capability requires more than events. Dragonfly exposes behavior through Go interfaces such as `world.Block`, `world.CustomBlock`, `world.EntityType`, `world.Entity`, `world.Generator`, `world.Provider`, item behavior interfaces, recipes, effects, and commands.

The framework mirrors these public extension points as generated capability descriptors and callbacks.

Two kinds of capability exist:

- Static capability: identity, block states, model, collision box, light level, item category, textures, entity bounding box, command schema. Rust declares it during bootstrap; Go caches it and answers Dragonfly without FFI.
- Dynamic capability: activation, ticking, entity interaction, damage, item use, chunk generation, provider I/O. Go proxy calls the Rust runtime with transaction-scoped input and receives mutations/actions.

Bootstrap must finish registration before `server.Config.New`, because Dragonfly finalizes registries and builds custom resource packs during server construction.

### Go proxies

Go proxy types implement Dragonfly interfaces and delegate behavior to plugin definitions:

```text
foreignBlock       implements world.Block
foreignCustomBlock implements world.CustomBlock and resource metadata
foreignItem        implements world.Item plus item behaviors
foreignEntityType  implements world.EntityType
foreignEntity      implements world.Entity/TickerEntity
foreignGenerator   implements world.Generator
foreignProvider    implements world.Provider
```

Dragonfly frequently uses Go interface presence as a capability check. A universal proxy that implements every optional interface would be incorrect: merely implementing `Liquid`, `Replaceable`, `Living`, or similar interfaces changes behavior.

Bridge rules:

- Implement behavior-neutral optional interfaces on a shared proxy only when defaults exactly match interface absence.
- Use separate proxy families for presence-sensitive roles such as liquid, conductor, custom block, ticking entity, living entity, generator, and provider.
- Generate capability-family selection from bootstrap descriptors.
- Add parity tests comparing an equivalent raw Go implementation with each proxy family.
- If a Dragonfly interface cannot be represented without semantic loss or combinatorial proxy explosion, add a narrow adapter hook to the maintained Dragonfly integration layer and propose it upstream.

Do not claim support for a capability until its proxy passes behavioral parity tests.

### Custom blocks

Rust SDK declares block identity, every state/permutation, model, collision/selection boxes, light, friction, hardness, resistance, materials, geometry, textures, and optional behavior callbacks.

```rust
server.blocks().register(
    Block::custom("example:launcher")
        .display_name("Launcher")
        .texture("all", assets.texture("launcher.png"))
        .strength(3.0)
        .on_activate(Self::activate_launcher),
);
```

Go registers all block states before registry finalization. Framework feeds plugin assets into Dragonfly's resource-pack build path.

### Custom items

Rust SDK declares identity, texture, category, stack size, durability, combat properties, food/consumption, cooldowns, and optional use/release callbacks. Go proxies implement relevant item behavior families and register items before server creation.

### Custom entities

Rust SDK supports base, ticking, and living entity families first, followed by specialized behavior capabilities. Entity definition contains network identity, bounding box, persistent state codec, spawn defaults, and callbacks.

Go owns `EntityHandle`, `EntityData`, world membership, viewer updates, and transaction validity. Rust owns plugin-defined state identified by an opaque instance ID. Tick callbacks receive one borrowed entity context and return state changes/actions. Entity NBT encode/decode routes through a versioned plugin state codec so plugin entities survive restarts.

### Custom generators and providers

A Rust generator receives chunk position, dimension metadata, seed/context, and a host-owned mutable chunk view. One FFI call fills a chunk; per-block FFI calls are forbidden.

A Rust provider implements settings, spawn positions, column load/store, and close through generated callbacks. Provider calls may perform I/O, so they use a separate blocking-capability pool and explicit error values. They never run on the hot event dispatcher lock.

### Other extension points

The same descriptor/proxy model covers:

- Dimensions and portal routing.
- Recipes and creative inventory.
- Enchantments and effects.
- Damage and healing sources.
- Game modes and permissions/allower logic.
- Player and world persistence providers.
- Resource packs.
- Typed commands and command permissions.
- Sounds, particles, structures, and entity actions. Player forms and scoreboards are supported through owned, bounded host bridges.

Each family belongs in schema. Language SDKs generate from it; only Go-to-Dragonfly proxy semantics remain handwritten.

### Meaning of parity

Parity means a plugin language can express every supported public Dragonfly extension interface and server operation for the pinned Dragonfly release with equivalent gameplay behavior.

Parity does not mean importing arbitrary Go packages, using unexported Dragonfly internals, passing Go objects through FFI, or monkey-patching concrete Go code. Those are not stable cross-language contracts.

## Rust SDK

Plugin code should contain only requested handlers. Events continue by default; handlers only cancel or mutate them:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Event, Plugin};

struct Example;

#[plugin]
impl Plugin for Example {
    fn on_move(&self, event: &mut Event::PlayerMove<'_>) {
        if event.new_position().y < 0.0 {
            event.cancel();
        }
    }

    fn on_chat(&self, event: &mut Event::PlayerChat<'_>) {
        let replacement = event.message().replace("foo", "bar");
        let _ = event.replace_message(&replacement);
    }
}
```

Event structs are namespaced as `Event::PlayerMove`, `Event::PlayerHurt`, and so on; the old root `PlayerMoveEvent` naming is intentionally unsupported during WIP. Hurt/death expose `damage_source()` with Dragonfly's armour, resistance, fire, and totem flags. Heal exposes `healing_source()`. Both preserve the concrete Go source type name for custom implementations.

All trait handlers have default no-op implementations. The `plugin` attribute sees which methods are implemented and generates the subscription bitmap and entry point, so Go skips unused events.

There is no `allow()` method or `allow` field. Zero/default ABI event state means continue. Cancellation is monotonic: `cancel()` sets the flag, and no API clears it. Each plugin sees mutations made by earlier plugins.

Rust SDK layers:

```text
dragonfly-plugin-sys     generated unsafe ABI
dragonfly-plugin        safe types and Plugin trait
dragonfly-plugin-macros entry point and dispatch generation
```

Plugins must be `Send + Sync`. Different Dragonfly worlds may invoke the runtime concurrently. Runtime-wide serialization would harm performance.

## Event processing

Use direct generated C structs, not JSON, Protobuf, or sockets.

Hot path:

```text
Dragonfly handler
  -> check subscription bit
  -> construct C-compatible input
  -> one cgo call
  -> Rust runtime dispatches subscribers
  -> return final event state
  -> Go updates Dragonfly context/pointer arguments
```

Keep common mutable state inline and allocation-free:

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t cancel;
} DfMoveState;
```

Go zero-initialises state before dispatch. `cancel == 0` means continue; `cancel != 0` means cancelled. Never generate a separate allow flag.

Variable output, such as chat replacement or block drops, uses an output arena owned by the Rust runtime and valid until the FFI call completes. The C bridge copies or applies it before returning to ordinary Go code.

For each event, mirror Dragonfly capability exactly. Example: `HandleMove` permits cancellation but does not expose a mutable target position, so Rust `Event::PlayerMove` must not claim position replacement support.

## Transaction-safe host actions

Dragonfly v0.11 entity values are transaction-scoped. The host registry stores stable `EntityHandle` references and cached identity, never reusable `*player.Player` pointers. Every command, event, and form-response callback receives a monotonic opaque invocation ID mapped to exactly one live `*world.Tx`. The Rust SDK scopes that ID with panic-safe thread-local storage and returns it on host calls. A target player is resolved from its handle only inside that exact transaction; the host never searches concurrent callbacks for a usable transaction.

Host callbacks execute synchronously while the plugin callback is active. Large values such as skins and item stacks use bounded Go-owned snapshots with RAII close on the Rust side. No Go pointer crosses or survives the ABI.

Forms are the deliberate asynchronous exception. `Player::send_form` transfers an owned `FnOnce + Send + 'static` callback into a bounded host registry. Dragonfly retains only an opaque registration ID, and dispatches the submitted or closed response inside the response transaction. Player disconnect, runtime disable, and runtime destruction drain pending callbacks before plugin libraries unload. The public API is fire-and-forget: host transport failures discard the callback without exposing native status values.

Separate event mutations from host actions.

Event mutations return directly:

- Cancel event.
- Replace chat text.
- Change damage, XP, drops, knockback, or other mutable arguments.

Current host actions include:

- Send message.
- Teleport player.
- Read/set managed-world blocks.
- Read/set world time and spawn.
- Open, save, and unload managed worlds.
- Spawn/list built-in entities and projectiles.
- Read and mutate common entity capabilities through stable handles.

Every synchronous player callback registers one invocation ID for its exact transaction. Same-world block operations use that `world.Tx` directly. Calls with no invocation are off-owner: writes enqueue through `World.Do` and reads use `world.Call`. Cross-world writes from callbacks enqueue, while cross-world synchronous block reads are rejected because reciprocal owner calls can deadlock. Save/unload are rejected from callbacks and run only off-owner. Transaction values never cross or survive the ABI; the asynchronous task API will provide callback-safe cross-world reads and lifecycle operations.

The host ABI is currently v10. WIP releases intentionally make breaking ABI changes instead of retaining compatibility shims; runtime and plugins must be compiled from the same revision.

## Entities

Go stores `*world.EntityHandle`, never transaction-scoped `world.Entity` values. IDs contain Dragonfly UUID plus monotonic generation; player and entity views of the same player share one identity. World handlers lazily track provider-loaded entities and expire closed handles without invalidating portal transfers.

Rust spawn descriptors are sealed and typed: `Text`, `Lightning`, `TNT`, `ExperienceOrb`, `DroppedItem`, `FallingBlock`, `Arrow`, `Egg`, `Snowball`, `EnderPearl`, `BottleOfEnchanting`, `SplashPotion`, and `LingeringPotion`. One flat ABI descriptor feeds Dragonfly constructors and registry factories, so adding language SDKs does not require one adapter per concrete type.

Common entity state is capability-based. Every managed entity exposes its `World`; position and rotation exist on every `world.Entity`, while velocity, teleport, and name tag are optional capabilities. Rust getters return `Option`, while unsupported/stale setters silently no-op and never expose host transport errors. Dragonfly v0.11 has no exported generic rotation setter, so only spawn-time rotation and rotation reads are supported. Reflection or unsafe access to private `entity.Ent` state is forbidden.

Entity spawn returns a handle synchronously, so it currently requires the target world to own the active callback transaction. Unlike fire-and-forget block writes, a cross-world spawn cannot be queued without changing its return type to an asynchronous task. The planned task API will carry the resulting handle; current callbacks must spawn in their own world, while off-callback code may spawn in any managed world.

`World::entities()` mirrors `Tx.Entities()`. `World::players()` provides stable player identities. `Tx.Viewers(position)` cannot honestly map to players: `world.Viewer` is an opaque output interface with no identity. Viewer identity support therefore needs an upstream Dragonfly capability API; returning fake player handles would be incorrect.

Projectile factories preserve Dragonfly owner resolution and built-in behavior. Current Dragonfly has no global projectile-impact callback: its per-config `Hit` callback is post-effect, non-cancellable, and misses surviving arrow/block collisions. A global cancellable projectile-hit event requires an upstream pre-impact hook. Reimplementing private potion, pearl, bottle, and arrow behavior in this project is rejected because it would drift from raw Dragonfly.

`Event::PlayerAttackEntity` is bridged at Dragonfly's native pre-damage handler. It exposes attacker, stable target entity, cancellable default-allowed state, knockback force/height, and critical flag. Cancellation remains monotonic across plugins.

`Event::PlayerItemUseOnEntity` is bridged before Dragonfly checks whether the held item implements `item.UsableOnEntity`. It exposes the player and stable target entity and remains cancellable/default-allowed, including when the player holds no item or the item has no entity-use behavior.

`Event::PlayerChangeWorld` mirrors Dragonfly's post-transfer callback. Dragonfly emits it on the player's first tick in the destination, not while initially joining and not for a same-world re-add. The callback is immutable and exposes `player()`, `before() -> Option<World>`, and `after() -> World`. Its invocation owns the destination transaction. The host records the source's stable world handle when the player departs, so `before()` remains exact even if that now-empty world unloads before the destination tick. Synchronous source-world reads remain unavailable from the destination callback; destination operations reuse the active transaction and cross-world writes follow the normal queued path.

`Event::PlayerRespawn` mirrors Dragonfly's pre-transfer respawn hook. It exposes mutable position and managed destination-world state without inventing cancellation. The callback invocation owns the source transaction because Dragonfly has not removed the player yet. Returned position and world changes are accepted together only when the position is finite and the destination handle names a live managed world. A destination that closes after the callback may still reject Dragonfly's later transfer; Dragonfly then restores the player to the source world.

## Particles and sounds

`particle::Particle` is sealed and implemented by typed descriptors for all Dragonfly v0.11 built-ins. The flat `DfParticleViewV1` carries only the union of concrete fields: colour, block, face/area/instrument data, note pitch, and dragon-egg offset. Go reconstructs the exact `world/particle` type and calls `Tx.AddParticle`; same-world callbacks reuse their transaction and cross-world calls enqueue through `World.Do`. Dragonfly has no particle registry or identifier strings, so the SDK does not invent a second naming system.

`sound::Sound` is sealed and covers all Dragonfly v0.11 concrete sound types. Parameterised descriptors carry typed blocks, items, instruments, discs, horns, liquids, stages, or scalar state through `DfSoundViewV1`; Go reconstructs the exact `world/sound` value. `World::play_sound` calls `Tx.PlaySound`, preserving Dragonfly's cancellable world sound handler and viewer broadcast. `Player::play_sound` uses Dragonfly's private-to-player playback at the player's eye position. Both APIs share the same descriptor types.

Dragonfly v0.11 does not expose `Player.StopSound`: the packet writer and player session are private. Exact stop-one/stop-all support needs an upstream public API and will not use reflection, `linkname`, or a fake `MusicDiscEnd` substitution.

## Items and inventories

`ItemStack` is an owned Rust value. It carries identifier, metadata, count, damage, unbreakable state, anvil cost, custom name, lore, item NBT, Dragonfly `WithValue` data, and registered enchantments. Item identity follows Dragonfly: typed values such as `item::Sword::new(item::ToolTier::Diamond)` encode identifier and Dragonfly's signed 16-bit metadata, while `item::new(item, count)` creates the stack. Generated simple items are zero-sized values such as `item::Diamond`. `item::Custom` is the explicit identifier/metadata escape hatch for plugin-registered items. Registered custom enchantment and potion IDs remain representable across the ABI. The ABI keeps metadata widened to `i32` for stable transport, converting at the typed API boundary.

NBT uses standard fixed little-endian named-root compounds. The SDK hides encoding and validates size, depth, element count, UTF-8, and homogeneous list types. Go `gob` payloads are never exposed as a language ABI.

`Player::inventory()`, `armour()`, and `offhand()` return small value handles containing player identity and inventory kind. Inventory reads and item-bearing events open immutable Go-owned snapshots; event snapshots live for the complete synchronous plugin chain. Writes borrow Rust buffers for one synchronous call. Snapshot reads preflight every capacity and perform no partial writes. Host status codes remain private to the SDK; setters do not expose transport failures as public booleans or errors. `add_item()` returns the domain-level count added. `held_items()`, `set_held_items()`, and `set_held_slot()` use the same conversion path.

## Object identity

Use opaque IDs with stale-reference protection:

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t uuid[16];
    uint64_t generation;
} DfPlayerId;

typedef struct {
    uint64_t value;
} DfWorldId;
```

Player generations prevent reconnection aliasing. World handles are monotonic and never reused, so an unloaded handle cannot affect a replacement world. IDs never contain Go addresses.

## Commands

Dragonfly commands use reflection over concrete Go `Runnable` structs. Dynamic native plugins cannot create new Go struct methods.

Raw commands use one generic Go runnable with `cmd.Varargs`:

```text
/plugin-command <raw arguments...>
```

Structured commands declare overloads containing literal subcommands, enums, strings, integers, floats, booleans, players, and trailing `Varargs`. The Go adapter maps them to Dragonfly `Runnable`, `ParamDescriber`, `Parameter`, and `Enum` implementations so Bedrock clients receive native command metadata.

Online players use the typed Rust `Player` argument. Bedrock receives a live-name enum, but Go resolves the chosen name at execution and transports a generation-tagged `PlayerId`; Rust never treats the mutable name as identity. Multi-target selectors remain a separate future `Targets` argument because their transaction-aware Dragonfly resolution has different semantics. Generic dynamic/soft enums are reserved for plugin-defined changing sets such as kits or arenas. Their options cross the ABI on Dragonfly's low-frequency command metadata path and may vary by command source.

Dynamic enum fields use `Dynamic<T>`, where `T: DynamicCommandEnum`. Dragonfly polls the provider through the native runtime and promotes changed values to a Bedrock soft enum. `CommandSource` exposes source identity and the current online-player names. The host registry owns stable generation-tagged player IDs; later player command parameters carry those IDs rather than Go pointers.

Go reflected runnable fields are transport only. `ParamDescriber` supplies client metadata, while generated Rust parsing owns validation and error text. A hidden trailing `Varargs` transport prevents Dragonfly syntax errors from leaking internal `P1`/`P2` field names.

Rust has no Go-style runtime reflection. Its equivalent plugin API uses attribute and derive proc macros at compile time. `#[command("root")]` on the plugin impl declares a command, bare `#[command]` marks its root runnable, and each `#[subcommand("name")]` method becomes another Dragonfly runnable. Method arguments generate schema and parsing. Derived command enums remain available for programmatic schemas; direct descriptors are the low-level escape hatch.

## Scope and parity target

- Built-in world provider and generator presets.
- Player join and quit.
- Player movement.
- Chat.
- Hurt and heal.
- Block break and place.
- Basic event-scoped messaging and cancellation.
- Raw and structured commands, including enums and subcommands.
- Player/world opaque IDs.

- Untrusted plugin sandboxing.
- Background-thread inventory mutation outside a Dragonfly transaction.
- Arbitrary Go-only `WithValue` types that cannot be represented by NBT.

Before product 1.0, parity work includes custom blocks, items, entities, generators, providers, registries, recipes, effects, enchantments, typed commands, persistence, and remaining public Dragonfly operations. Bootstrap is deliberately placed before `Config.New` because Dragonfly registers and finalizes many of these types during server construction.

Native safety limitations are permanent: no hot unload, no sandboxing, and a native crash may terminate the server. Capability limitations are not permanent exclusions.

Generated files must contain a warning and generator version. CI fails if regeneration changes committed output.

## Safety model

Native plugins are trusted code:

- Segfaults kill the server.
- Infinite loops block the calling Dragonfly transaction.
- Rust panics must be caught inside generated entry points.
- No panic or exception may cross the C ABI.
- Plugins may not retain borrowed pointers.
- Plugins may not use event objects after callbacks return.
- All FFI functions document thread-safety.

Process isolation and WebAssembly are deliberately excluded because this project chooses one native mechanism and prioritises raw-handler performance.

## Verification

Required tests:

- C/Rust size, alignment, and field-offset agreement.
- ABI version and `struct_size` compatibility.
- Unknown event handling.
- Borrowed string and slice lifetime tests.
- Plugin panic containment.
- Duplicate ID and dependency-cycle rejection.
- Concurrent callbacks from multiple worlds.
- Cancellation and mutation parity with raw Go handlers.
- Stale player/world ID rejection.
- Automatic dispatcher installation for core and plugin worlds.
- World creation, evacuation, unload, save, and shutdown ordering.
- Bootstrap conflict resolution.
- API scanner coverage for every pinned Dragonfly extension interface.
- Static custom block/item metadata without hot-path FFI.
- Dynamic block/item callback parity against equivalent Go types.
- Custom entity tick, persistence, despawn, and reload.
- Chunk generator correctness and calls-per-chunk.
- Provider error and concurrency behavior.
- Fixture plugin loaded through the complete Go-to-Rust path.

Required benchmarks:

- Raw Go `NopHandler` baseline.
- Runtime loaded with zero subscribers.
- One no-op Rust movement subscriber.
- Ten no-op Rust movement subscribers.
- Rust movement handler with real validation.
- 2,000, 20,000, and 100,000 movement events per second.
- Go allocations per event and latency distribution.

Target hot path properties:

- Zero FFI calls when no plugin subscribes.
- One cgo call per subscribed event, independent of plugin count.
- No heap allocation for fixed-size events such as movement.
- No global runtime lock during event dispatch.
- Measured overhead documented against raw Go baseline.

Exact equality with raw Go is impossible because FFI has a boundary. Acceptance should be based on measured server impact, not a claim of zero overhead.

## Delivery plan

### Phase 0: performance spike

- Build minimal Go-to-Rust runtime call.
- Load one and ten fixture plugins.
- Implement no-op and validating movement callbacks.
- Run required benchmarks.
- Confirm one-call runtime design before expanding API.

### Phase 1: schema and ABI foundation

- Define schema format and stable event IDs.
- Build ABI generator.
- Generate C header, Rust `sys` types, safe Rust types, dispatch, and layout tests.
- Add ABI version negotiation and feature bits.
- Add Dragonfly public-interface scanner and coverage report.

### Phase 2: runtime and SDK

- Add manifest discovery and dependency ordering.
- Add native plugin loading without unload.
- Add safe `Plugin` trait and export macro.
- Add panic guards, logging, priorities, and subscription tables.
- Add generated `ServerBuilder`, `ServerPlan`, and world SDK types.

### Phase 3: owned server lifecycle

- Implement server executable and configuration.
- Own `Config.New`, `Listen`, `Accept`, and shutdown.
- Implement bootstrap-plan collection and validation.
- Implement host manager and automatic player attachment.
- Implement composite player and world handlers.
- Never retain transaction-scoped objects.

### Phase 4: managed worlds

- Register and configure core worlds automatically.
- Add namespaced plugin-world registry.
- Add built-in provider and generator presets.
- Add create, lookup, save, unload, evacuation, and player-transfer operations.
- Install dispatchers before any world becomes plugin-visible.

### Phase 5: first useful event API

- Add join, quit, movement, chat, hurt, heal, block break, and block place.
- Add exact cancellation/mutation mapping.
- Add event-scoped message action.
- Ship chat-filter and movement-guard examples.

### Phase 6: commands and actions

- Add raw-argument commands.
- Add structured enum/subcommand descriptors and Dragonfly metadata adapters.
- Add Rust derives that generate descriptors and argument parsing at compile time.
- Add synchronous transaction-aware player actions.
- Add transaction-safe teleport, block, sound, and particle operations without retaining Dragonfly transaction values.

### Phase 7: Dragonfly capability parity

- Implement custom block and item descriptors, assets, proxy families, and behavior callbacks.
- Implement custom entity base/ticking/living families and persistent state codec.
- Implement chunk-level Rust generators and provider callbacks.
- Implement remaining registry and capability families from scanner report.
- Reach complete public-extension coverage for pinned Dragonfly version.

### Phase 8: hardening and packaging

- Add Linux and macOS CI.
- Publish Rust SDK crates.
- Document supported targets and toolchains.
- Add ABI inspection CLI.
- Pin supported Dragonfly commit/version and test upgrades explicitly.

## First implementation milestone

Deliver only:

1. Schema generator.
2. One Rust runtime.
3. Server executable owning Dragonfly lifecycle.
4. World manager owning the three core worlds and one plugin-created flat world.
5. One FFI movement event.
6. One FFI chat event.
7. One plugin that declares its world during bootstrap and teleports players into it.
8. Benchmarks against equivalent raw Go handlers.

Do not wrap the entire Dragonfly API before this milestone proves performance, generated bindings, and transaction semantics.
