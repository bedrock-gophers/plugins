# Example plugin output

Each plugin owns its `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, source, and target directory. `make run` builds each plugin manifest and stages native libraries in this directory.

Precompiled native plugin libraries may also be placed in this directory. Runtime loads both compiled examples and compatible precompiled plugins.

Included examples cover movement cancellation, chat mutation, lifecycle and mutable skin-change hooks, Dragonfly command registration, player latency queries, typed items, scoreboards, all Dragonfly form families, managed worlds, typed entity/projectile operations, and all built-in world particles.
