# bedrock-gophers/plugins

Native multi-language plugin runtime for [df-mc/dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). Rust is the first supported plugin language.

Current status: native runtime foundation plus player actions, typed items, inventories, scoreboards, asynchronous forms, managed worlds, stable entity handles, built-in entity/projectile spawning, typed world particles and sounds, and entity attack/use events. Generated events, lifecycle hooks, Dragonfly commands, bounded snapshots, and host actions travel through Go, the native Rust runtime, and dynamically loaded Rust plugins.

## Build and test

Requirements:

- Go 1.26+
- Rust 1.96+
- C compiler and `dlopen` support

```shell
make test
make benchmark
```

Build and run owned server:

```shell
make run
```

`make run` compiles example Rust plugins, stages them under `examples/plugins`, then runs root Go command using `examples/server.toml`. Framework derives native runtime library path for current platform; config contains no `.so` path.

Framework creates Dragonfly, installs world/player handlers, owns accept loop, and closes cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

Framework world manager protects `minecraft:overworld`, `minecraft:nether`, and `minecraft:end`; custom worlds use namespaced IDs such as `example:lobby`. It installs handlers before publication and owns save/unload cleanup.

Rust can look up core worlds, open persistent custom worlds, read/write typed block states, and manage time/spawn:

```rust
use dragonfly::{BlockPos, Dimension, World, block};

let world = World::open("example:arena", Dimension::Overworld);
if let Some(world) = world {
    let pillar = block::new("minecraft:oak_log").with_property("pillar_axis", "y");
    world.set_block(BlockPos { x: 0, y: 64, z: 0 }, &pillar);
    world.set_time(6000);
}
```

World handles are opaque and never reused. The world API derives custom-world paths from namespaced IDs below `worlds.directory`; this is path organization, not a security sandbox—native plugins already run with the server process's filesystem access. Every callback carries an opaque invocation ID, so same-world operations reuse exactly that callback's Dragonfly `world.Tx`, never another concurrent callback's transaction. Off-owner writes use `World.Do`. Synchronous cross-world block reads are unavailable inside callbacks until the task API lands, preventing reciprocal world-owner deadlocks.

Entities use generation-tagged `world.EntityHandle` identities. Typed descriptors keep Go adapter code shared:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Vec3, World, entity, item};

if let Some(world) = World::overworld() {
    let options = entity::SpawnOptions::new(Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 65.0, z: 0.0 });
    let text = world.spawn_entity(entity::Text::new("Hello"), options.clone());
    let sword = item::new(item::Sword::new(item::ToolTier::Diamond), 1);
    let dropped = world.spawn_entity(entity::DroppedItem::new(sword), options);
    if let Some(text) = text {
        text.set_name_tag("Updated");
    }
}
```

`World::entities()` and `World::players()` resolve within the current transaction. `Entity` exposes its managed world, type, position, rotation, optional velocity/name tag, teleport, velocity/name-tag mutation, and despawn. Dragonfly v0.11 has no exported generic rotation setter, so rotation mutation is deliberately absent rather than implemented with reflection. Projectiles use typed owner handles (`Arrow`, `Snowball`, `Egg`, `EnderPearl`, bottles, and potions). Dragonfly has no global pre-impact projectile hook; a correct cancellable projectile-hit event needs an upstream hook and is not faked by rebuilding private projectile behaviour.

Synchronous entity spawning inside a callback must target that callback's current world. Cross-world spawning will return an asynchronous handle task when the task API lands; off-callback code may already spawn in any managed world.

Particles mirror Dragonfly's concrete types rather than inventing string identifiers:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Vec3, World, block, particle};

if let Some(world) = World::overworld() {
    world.add_particle(Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 65.0, z: 0.0 }, particle::HugeExplosion);
    world.add_particle(
        Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 65.0, z: 0.0 },
        particle::BlockBreak::new(block::new("minecraft:diamond_block")),
    );
}
```

Sounds use the same typed model for private player playback and transaction-aware world playback:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Vec3, World, block, item, sound};

player.play_sound(sound::LevelUp);
if let Some(world) = World::overworld() {
    world.play_sound(
        Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 65.0, z: 0.0 },
        sound::DoorOpen::new(
            block::new("minecraft:wooden_door")
                .with_property("minecraft:cardinal_direction", "north")
                .with_property("door_hinge_bit", false)
                .with_property("open_bit", false)
                .with_property("upper_block_bit", false),
        ),
    );
    world.play_sound(
        Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 65.0, z: 0.0 },
        sound::EquipItem::new(item::Sword::new(item::ToolTier::Diamond)),
    );
}
```

Regenerate ABI files after changing `schema/`:

```shell
make generate
```

## Rust plugin example

```rust
use dragonfly::{Event, Plugin, plugin};

#[derive(Default)]
struct MovementGuard;

#[plugin]
impl Plugin for MovementGuard {
    fn on_move(&self, event: &mut Event::PlayerMove<'_>) {
        if event.new_position().y < 0.0 {
            event.cancel();
        }
    }
}
```

Events continue by default. Cancellation is monotonic; no `allow()` API exists.
Plugin identity defaults to Cargo's package name; handler code does not repeat it.

Event types live only under `Event::Player*`. Damage and healing sources are typed values: hurt/death expose `damage_source()`, while heal exposes `healing_source()`. `Event::PlayerChangeWorld` is emitted after transfer on the first destination tick. `Event::PlayerRespawn` runs before transfer and may replace both the spawn position and managed destination world.

Items are owned Rust values. Inventory handles stay attached to the generation-tagged player:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Enchantment, Player, item};

fn give_sword(player: Player) {
    let sword = item::new(item::Sword::new(item::ToolTier::Diamond), 1)
        .with_custom_name("Rust Sword")
        .with_lore(["Created by a native plugin"])
        .with_value("plugin", "example")
        .with_enchantment(Enchantment::Sharpness, 5);
    player.inventory().add_item(&sword);
}
```

`Player::inventory()`, `armour()`, and `offhand()` expose get/set/add/clear operations. Mutating setters are fire-and-forget; host transport statuses stay internal. `add_item()` returns only the useful domain result: the count added. `held_items()`, `set_held_items()`, and `set_held_slot()` mirror Dragonfly. Inventory reads and item events preserve count, metadata, damage, unbreakable state, anvil cost, custom name, lore, NBT, `WithValue` data, and enchantments through bounded snapshots. NBT uses standard little-endian encoding, not Go `gob` bytes.

Scoreboards are owned snapshots with Dragonfly's 15-line limit, padding, and display-order controls:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Player, Scoreboard, ScoreboardLineOutOfBounds};

fn show_scoreboard(player: Player) -> Result<(), ScoreboardLineOutOfBounds> {
    let mut board = Scoreboard::new("Match");
    board.push_line("Red: 3")?.push_line("Blue: 2")?;
    player.send_scoreboard(&board);
    Ok(())
}
```

`send_scoreboard()` and `remove_scoreboard()` are fire-and-forget; native host transport failures remain internal.

Forms cover Dragonfly's menu, modal, and custom families, including every v0.11 element. Responses use owned one-shot callbacks because Dragonfly answers asynchronously:

```rust
use dragonfly::{Player, form};

fn choose(player: Player) {
    let mut menu = form::Menu::new("Choose").body("Pick an option.");
    let first = menu.button(form::Button::new("First"));
    player.send_form(menu, move |player, response| {
        if response.is_some_and(|response| response.selected() == first) {
            player.message("First selected");
        }
    });
}
```

`send_form()` and `close_form()` are fire-and-forget. Submit and close callbacks run inside Dragonfly's response transaction; disconnect, disable, and shutdown safely discard pending callbacks before plugin libraries unload.

Built-in item identities are typed and mirror Dragonfly's item model: `item::new(item, count)` creates the stack, and metadata belongs to the item type. `item::Custom` is the explicit escape hatch for plugin-registered identifiers.

Commands use compile-time macros in place of Go runtime reflection. `#[command("root")]` declares the command, and each `#[subcommand("name")]` method becomes a Dragonfly runnable with generated native metadata and parsing. See the hello-command example for general command arguments and the items-command example for inventory operations.

See [native plugin architecture](docs/plans/rust-plugin-architecture.md).
