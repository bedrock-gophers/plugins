# bedrock-gophers/plugins

Native multi-language plugin runtime for [df-mc/dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). Rust is the first supported plugin language.

Current status: native runtime foundation. Generated events, lifecycle hooks, and Dragonfly commands travel through Go, the native Rust runtime, and dynamically loaded Rust plugins.

## Build and test

Requirements:

- Go 1.26+
- Rust 1.96+
- C compiler and `dlopen` support

```shell
make test
make benchmark
```

Build and run owned server:

```shell
make run
```

`make run` compiles example Rust plugins, stages them under `examples/plugins`, then runs root Go command using `examples/server.toml`. Framework derives native runtime library path for current platform; config contains no `.so` path.

Framework creates Dragonfly, installs world/player handlers, owns accept loop, and closes cleanly on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

Framework world manager protects `minecraft:overworld`, `minecraft:nether`, and `minecraft:end`; custom worlds use namespaced IDs such as `example:lobby`. It installs handlers before publication and owns save/unload cleanup.

Regenerate ABI files after changing `schema/`:

```shell
make generate
```

## Rust plugin example

```rust
use dragonfly_plugin::{PlayerMoveEvent, Plugin, plugin};

#[derive(Default)]
struct MovementGuard;

#[plugin]
impl Plugin for MovementGuard {
    fn on_move(&self, event: &mut PlayerMoveEvent<'_>) {
        if event.new_position().y < 0.0 {
            event.cancel();
        }
    }
}
```

Events continue by default. Cancellation is monotonic; no `allow()` API exists.
Plugin identity defaults to Cargo's package name; handler code does not repeat it.

Commands use compile-time macros in place of Go runtime reflection. `#[command("root")]` declares the command, and each `#[subcommand("name")]` method becomes a Dragonfly runnable with generated native metadata and parsing. See the hello-command example for the complete form.

See [native plugin architecture](docs/plans/rust-plugin-architecture.md).

## Examples

- [Movement guard](examples/plugins/movement-guard): cancels movement below Y=0.
- [Chat filter](examples/plugins/chat-filter): replaces text and cancels a blocked message.
- [Lifecycle logger](examples/plugins/lifecycle-logger): demonstrates enable and disable hooks.
- [Hello command](examples/plugins/hello-command): demonstrates Dragonfly subcommands and enum parameters.

The examples compile as native plugin libraries through `make stage-examples`. Precompiled `.so`, `.dylib`, or `.dll` plugins may also be placed directly in `examples/plugins`.
