# C# plugin architecture

## Direction

- C# NativeAOT is the only plugin language.
- The public namespace mirrors Dragonfly's packages and exported types as closely as C# permits.
- Plugins subclass `Plugin`; generated build plumbing supplies the native entry point and project-name identity.
- The Go host owns Dragonfly and exposes a private flat C ABI. Plugins never use ABI types.
- Code generation reads the pinned Dragonfly Go source with `go/ast` and emits C#; there is no second public API schema.

## Shape

```text
Dragonfly Go API -> Go AST generator -> C# Dragonfly API
                                         |
                                         v
plugin source -> NativeAOT .so -> private C ABI -> Go host -> Dragonfly
```

The ABI is transport, not the API. C# names, interfaces, constructors, and behavior should come from Dragonfly. Hand-written code is limited to marshalling semantics that cannot be inferred from Go types.

## Order

1. NativeAOT loading and `OnEnable`/`OnDisable`.
2. `player.Handler` events. Movement, chat, food loss, jump, teleport, sprint/sneak toggles, punch-air, and quit are implemented.
3. Player methods and commands. Command interfaces and the implemented `Player` method surface are generated from Dragonfly's Go AST. C# uses `Cmd.New`/`Cmd.Register`, one `Cmd.Runnable` per overload, and reflected public fields as Dragonfly uses reflected Go struct fields. Supported command fields include subcommands, native enums, dynamic `Cmd.Enum` values, players, vectors, optional values, and `Cmd.Varargs`. The generator roots runnable fields and field types for NativeAOT; runnable types use `internal` visibility and require no linker annotations. Bedrock-facing subcommands and enum/player suggestions are always lowercase. `Player.SetGameMode(World.GameMode)` and Dragonfly's four built-in game-mode values are available. The text slice includes `Message`, `SendPopup`, `SendTip`, `SendJukeboxPopup`, `SetNameTag`, and `Disconnect`. `Messagef` remains absent until Go `fmt.Sprintf` semantics can be preserved honestly.
4. World and block parity. The first landed slice generates `Cube.Pos`, `Cube.Range`,
   `Cube.Face`, `World.Block`, `World.SetOpts`, `World.Tx.Range`, `World.Tx.Block`,
   `World.Tx.BlockLoaded`, `World.Tx.BlocksWithin`, `World.Tx.SetBlock`,
   `World.Tx.HighestLightBlocker`, `World.Tx.HighestBlock`, `World.Tx.Light`,
   `World.Tx.SkyLight`, 79 stateless block types, and `Block.Sand`.
   Transaction method signatures and parameter names come from Dragonfly's `world.Tx` Go AST;
   `BlockLoaded` preserves Dragonfly's non-loading query through a C# tuple. `BlocksWithin` maps
   `iter.Seq[cube.Pos]` to lazy `IEnumerable<Cube.Pos>` backed by a transaction-scoped native
   iterator; it is not materialised into a snapshot. `Player.Context : World.Context : World.Tx`,
   so event handlers use world operations directly just like embedded Dragonfly contexts.
   Registered block states supply canonical private codecs; public plugins never handle
   identifiers, NBT, world handles, iterator handles, or host errors. Remaining stateful blocks,
   liquids, structures, world methods, custom blocks, and block models land incrementally.
5. Items, forms, entities, particles, sounds, and remaining world/block methods.
6. Convert practice-core and expand parity tests against Dragonfly.

Each slice removes the replaced legacy implementation. Unsupported API remains absent rather than gaining a parallel abstraction.

Block access belongs on `World.Tx`. Do not revive `WorldSync`, expose the framework's
`WorldManager` or namespaced world IDs, or restore schema/block-gen as a second public model. Go
AST owns exported shape; Dragonfly's live registry supplies encoded state bytes; the C ABI only
transports calls.

`examples/plugins/kitchen-sink` must use every exposed API. Its `/kitchen block` overload reads the
block below the source through `World.Tx`, writes typed `Block.Sand`, and exercises all three
`World.SetOpts` flags, reads the world range, performs a non-loading block lookup, lazily searches
nearby blocks, and reads height/light data. NativeAOT and host-call tests verify the public shape,
lazy iterator cleanup, and transaction-safe transport.

`examples/plugins/vanilla-commands` keeps its plugin entry tiny and one command per file. It currently exercises `/gamemode`, `/help`, `/ping`, and `/position`, and expands with each gameplay parity slice.

Practice remains out of the parity loop until the framework API needed by practice exists. Feature work lands and is tested in this repository first.
